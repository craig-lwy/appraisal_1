[Click to download Excel file](projects-excel/E001_Dashboard_2025.05.01_v1.5.xlsx)


## Overview
An **interactive and dynamic** Excel dashboard designed to help users quickly understand key insights and gain a clear overview of the data.


## Tools Used
- Power Query
- Power Pivot
- DAX & star schema


## What was done
*In ascending order of the tabs in the workbook*

| Tab | Intended Use | Screenshot |
| --- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Intro | Outlining composition of the workbook and tools used | [image](images/E001/E001_page_01_intro.png) |
| Dashboard | An interactive, time-sliced dashboard that allows users drill down from Year to Quater to Month and vice versa | [image](images/E001/E001_page_02_Dashboard.png) |
| Treemap1 | A time-sliced graph that is split by fuel type and brand so users would intuitively know the market share components (i.e. which fuel type donminates the market and which brand donminates which fuel type) | [image](images/E001/E001_page_03_Treemap1.png) |
| Checking_table | This page reiterates the table that goes into the underlying DAX calculation to ensure all dashboard figures reconcile accurately. It supports deeper investigation of specific values and is especially helpful for reporting and error checking. | [image](images/E001/E001_page_04_Checking_table.png) |
| Ptbl_1 | The underlying table that gives Chart_1 on the Dashboard | - |
| Ptbl_2 | The underlying table that gives Chart_2 on the Dashboard | - |
| Ptbl_3 | The underlying table that gives Chart_3 on the Dashboard | - |
| Ptbl_4 | The underlying table that gives Chart_4 on the Dashboard | - |
| Ptbl_5 | The underlying table that gives Chart_5 on the Dashboard | - |
| fct_1_to_treemap1 | The underlying table that gives Treemap1 | [image](images/E001/E001_page_10_fct_1_to_treemap1.png) |
| data | This is the source data area. To update the Dashboard and Treemap1, simply paste new data into the *fct_1* table and click *Refresh All* under the *Data* in the excel ribbon - this will automatically update all related visuals on the green tabs. | [image](images/E001/E001_page_11_data.png) |
| dim_1_time | A dimension table that marks time | [image](images/E001/E001_page_12_dim_1_time.png) |
| dim_2_vc | A dimension table that marks the vehicle class | [image](images/E001/E001_page_13_dim_2_vc.png) |
| dim_3_make | A dimension table that marks the vehicle make | [image](images/E001/E001_page_14_dim_3_make.png) |
| dim_4_frs | A dimension table that marks the first registration status | [image](images/E001/E001_page_15_dim_4_frs.png) |
| dim_5_bt | A dimension table that marks the vehicle body type | [image](images/E001/E001_page_16_dim_5_bt.png) |
| dim_6_ft | A dimension table that marks the vehicle fuel type | [image](images/E001/E001_page_17_dim_6_ft.png) |


## Strengths, Weaknesses and Opportunities

| # | Strength | Weaknesses | Opportunities |
|---|----------|------------|---------------|
| 1 | If regular updates are required, the process can be handled by a junior team member, with oversight and review provided by a senior team member to ensure accuracy and consistency | Manual copy-paste is required | Maybe the data download and copy-paste process could be automated via Python? |
| 2 | All visuals update automatically. No manual dragging or repositioning is needed during each refresh | As the volume of source data increases, the workbook size also grows, which can lead to slower performance over time | While the source data could be stored externally—such as in .csv files or a database—for the purposes of this exercise, it is kept within the workbook for simplicity and ease of access |
