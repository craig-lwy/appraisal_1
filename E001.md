*In ascending order of the tabs in the workbook*
| Tab | Intended Use | Screenshot |
| --- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Intro | Outlining composition of the workbook and tools used | [image](images/E001/E001_page_01_intro.png) |
| Dashboard | An interactive, time-sliced dashboard that allows users drill down from Year to Quater to Month and vice versa | [image](images/E001/E001_page_02_Dashboard.png) |
| Treemap1 | A time-sliced graph that is split by fuel type and brand so users would intuitively know the market share components (i.e. which fuel type donminates the market and which brand donminates which fuel type) | [image](images/E001/E001_page_03_Treemap1.png) |
| Checking_table | This page reiterates the table that goes into the underlying DAX calculation to ensure all dashboard figures reconcile accurately. It supports deeper investigation of specific values and is especially helpful for reporting and error checking. | [image](images/E001/E001_page_04_Checking_table.png) |
