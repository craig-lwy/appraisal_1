- DAX & star schema


## What was done
*In ascending order of the tabs in the workbook*
| Tab | Intended Use | Screenshot |
| --- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Intro | Outlining composition of the workbook and tools used | [image](images/E001/E001_page_01_intro.png) |
| Dashboard | An interactive, time-sliced dashboard that allows users drill down from Year to Quater to Month and vice versa | [image](images/E001/E001_page_02_Dashboard.png) |
| Treemap1 | A time-sliced graph that is split by fuel type and brand so users would intuitively know the market share components (i.e. which fuel type donminates the market and which brand donminates which fuel type) | [image](images/E001/E001_page_03_Treemap1.png) |
| Checking_table | This page reiterates the table that goes into the underlying DAX calculation to ensure all dashboard figures reconcile accurately. It supports deeper investigation of specific values and is especially helpful for reporting and error checking. | [image](images/E001/E001_page_04_Checking_table.png) |
| Ptbl_1 | The underlying table that gives Chart_1 on the Dashboard | - |
| Ptbl_2 | The underlying table that gives Chart_2 on the Dashboard | - |
| Ptbl_3 | The underlying table that gives Chart_3 on the Dashboard | - |
| Ptbl_4 | The underlying table that gives Chart_4 on the Dashboard | - |
| Ptbl_5 | The underlying table that gives Chart_5 on the Dashboard | - |
| fct_1_to_treemap1 | The underlying table that gives Treemap1 | [image](images/E001/E001_page_10_fct_1_to_treemap1.png) |
| data | This is the source data area. To update the Dashboard and Treemap1, simply paste new data into the *fct_1* table and click *Refresh All* under the *Data* in the excel ribbon - this will automatically update all related visuals on the green tabs. | [image](images/E001/E001_page_11_data.png) |




## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
- Not scalable for more than ~5000 transactions
- Manual monthly copy-paste required (currently)

## üöÄ Future Improvements
- Add VBA automation for file import
- Convert into Power BI for better scalability
