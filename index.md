# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

Hi, I'm Craig â€” a budding data analyst with a background in accounting.

I created this site to share some of the projects I've worked on, both professionally and in my spare time. Youâ€™ll also find a few thoughts and reflections Iâ€™ve had along the way as I learn and grow in this field.

Over time, I hope this space becomes something meaningful â€” a place that not only showcases my journey but also connects with others who are exploring similar paths.

Whether you're a potential employer, a fellow data enthusiast, or just passing through â€” thank you for stopping by. Wishing you a great day ahead!
