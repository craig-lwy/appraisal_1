# Welcome

Hi! I am Craig — a budding data analyst with a background in accounting.

I created this site to share some of the projects that I have worked on, both professionally and in my spare time. You will also find a few thoughts and reflections I have had along the way as I learn and grow in this field.

Over time, I hope this space becomes something meaningful. A place that not only showcases my journey but also connects with others who are exploring similar paths.

Whether you are a potential employer, a fellow data enthusiast, or just passing through — thank you for stopping by. Wishing you a great day ahead!
