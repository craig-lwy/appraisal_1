## Why Bother?

People often ask: **“Why take the time to do your own books?”**

My answer is simple: **Because I believe in the power of numbers.**  
If I get paid to manage finances for businesses, why shouldn’t I apply the same discipline to my own life?

Managing my own books provides a clear and comprehensive view of my financial position. Digging into the numbers reveals patterns in my spending behavior and highlights both my strengths and areas for improvement. **This insight empowers me to set ambitious yet attainable goals and to back them with realistic, actionable plans.**


## How I Do It  

I follow the standard accounting process. Nothing fancy, just consistency.

- <ins>Daily</ins> : I record transactions using QuickBooks Online.  
- <ins>Monthly</ins> : I update schedules, reconcile my bank accounts, and run a quick variance analysis.

It is like running a business — **and yes, I am my own business. I find ways to grow those numbers.**


## What If It Gets Too Time-Consuming?

Yes, it can be. But as I always remind myself: **"Good data does not come easy but it pays off."**

And honestly? I hope most of the entries I am logging are income or asset-building, not just expenses and liabilities.


## When Things Don’t Go to Plan

Sometimes external factors or habits shift. That is when I fall back on something I learned as a financial analyst:  
**Run a quick SWOT analysis.**

- A full deep dive is preferred, but not always necessary. Even a single insight per quadrant can bring structure and direction.
- Clarity grows as we sketch things out.

**A well-grounded recovery plan is essential, but it is the follow-through/the call to action that brings about changes desired.**


## Looking Ahead

This is not just about balancing books. **It is about shaping the future to one's advantage.**

- I start with a basic plan based on what I know now;
- follow the process, make adjustments along the way, and keep collecting data;
- eventually, meanings will be told. New ideas and directions emerge.

## The Takeaway: Work Like I Live

I bring the same discipline and data-driven thinking to work. If you're a future employer, know this:  

**With this mindset, we have the potential to go far together.**
