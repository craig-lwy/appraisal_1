This is the **storytelling** page. The technical page is [here](./E003_technicals.md).


## Narrative

In E002 we explored a simulation that suggested an expected annual spending range of HKD 21,500 to HKD 36,800 at Jumpin Gym U.S.A.. Now with five months of 2025 already behind us. How are we tracking so far? **Is the year unfolding within expectations, or are we heading for a surprise landing?**

## Looking at the Results

By the end of May 2025, I have already accumulated a total spend of HKD 14,100 at Jumpin Gym U.S.A., averaging around HKD 3,000 per month.

If this trend continues, I am projected to land at approximately HKD 36,140 by year-end, which is between the 95th percentile and the maximum. That is clearly higher than ideal so it is time to tighten the reins on spending.

Let’s consider a more controlled scenario:
If I cap monthly spending at HKD 2,000 (e.g. HKD 500 per week), the year-end total would come in around HKD 29,140, which is between the 25th and 75th percentiles. It is not quite what I had originally hoped for, but it is far more sustainable than the high end of the distribution.

Initially, I expected to land somewhere closer to the minimum to 25th percentile. To achieve that, say a maximum annual spend of HKD 23,280, I now only have HKD 8,140 remaining for the rest of the year. That means the budget needs to stay at or below HKD 290 for each successful visit.

## The Recovery Plan

This simple plan should guide me towards the projection line or the 5th to 25th quartile:

- Limit each successful visit to HKD 500 or less.

- Skip a session when possible. And do not carry the budget forward.

- Reassess in two months to evaluate progress and adjust as needed.

In the meantime, take good care of myself and my sister. After all, fun should be joyful, not stressful!

## Key Takeaways

- **The fan chart provides an intuitive visual** for projecting possible outcomes. It makes it easy to assess where I am likely to land by year-end.

- **It offers clarity on direction.** It helps me adjust my behavior in real time to stay aligned with my financial expectations.

- **Early awareness enables proactive decisions.** I can correct course now rather than react later.

- **This exercise strengthens my data mindset.** It balances enjoyment and discipline through informed analysis.
