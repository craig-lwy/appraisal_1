# Reflection: The Logical Oversight

<sup> R001 </sup>


Back in my first year of university in year 2009, I got my first taste of creating visuals in Excel for a mock executive report. It sparked something in me. I even taught myself VBA to take it a step further.

The night before the deadline, I wanted to impress by adding input validation. I used `IsNumeric` to check if users entered a number—so far, so good. But then I thought: “What if they enter text? Surely there must be some functions like IsText or IsChar, right?”

The search began at midnight, then it turned into 1 a.m., 2 a.m., 3 a.m.—still no such function. Frustrated, I eventually gave up and went to bed. And just as my head hit the pillow, it hit me:

**If `IsNumeric` is False… that is the non-number check!**

Four hours of searching for a function that was not needed. **All because I overlooked flipping a Boolean.**
